# Vitls Test

Hello I am **Andreia Sarmento** and this is a simple test to demonstrate skills with **CSS3, HTML and Vanilla JavaScript** for the **front-end  developer position at Vitls**.  It was designed based on the  framework provided (please find it inside the folder `framework/Front-end developer role - Technical challenge.pdf`).  All content was made from scratch. The idea was go back to basics and create a project without any helpers. If for any reason Vitls wants me to demonstrate knowledge of server-side or frontend frameworks such as angular or react I am happy to do so. It would work on most modern browser.
